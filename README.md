This is the part of a port folio project of data cleaning using MySql work bench. In this project global layoffs data is used to cleanse the data within the MySql and also conduct explatory data analysis (EDA) on global layoffs and try to understanding of the trends and factors influencing employment changes.

----- Data Cleaning Process: To ensure the integrity and quality of our analysis, the following data cleaning steps were meticulously executed.

----- Upload the Data: The dataset was imported into the MySQL database system, setting the stage for our cleaning operations.

----- Remove Duplicates: We identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain the uniqueness of each data entry.

----- Standardize the Data: Data standardization procedures were applied to bring uniformity to the dataset, facilitating accurate comparisons and analysis.

----- Null Value Treatment: Null or blank values were addressed, either by removal or imputation, to prevent any gaps in the dataset that could skew our analysis.

----- Column and Row Pruning: Irrelevant columns and rows that did not contribute to our analysis objectives were prudently removed.
